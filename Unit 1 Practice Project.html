        <p class="overview">Hello I am working on make a big change in my career. This is something that I wasnt expecting to do at this point in my life but here we are.
           I had a passion for tech as a hobbie for a long time. At 35 there is no better time to just into something totally new.
        </p>
        <h2 id="How-I-got-my-start">How I got my start</h2>

        <p> I think seeing some friends make mods to some of my favorite games, but the code just seemed to look intimadating to me.
            For a long time I have always been interested in coding/ developement, sadly let my fear of failure get the best of me.
            I have played with coding in small ways, from adopting a little screen to display computer temps and what not, to updating firmware on a 3D printer.
            Lastly my spouse has been coding for about 5+ years and seeing her grow in this field has inspired me.
        </p>
        <p>The reason I choose Grand Circus my spouse when through the program and had a positive experience.
           Also my employer offers a really impressive discount that I couldnt pass up.
